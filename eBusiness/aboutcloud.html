        <h3 style="color:white;"><li>Software as a Service:(Saas):</li><li>Software as a service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available to customers over the Internet. SaaS removes the need for organizations to install and run applications on their own computers or in their own data centers. This eliminates the expense of hardware acquisition, provisioning and maintenance, as well as software licensing, installation and support. Other benefits of the SaaS model include:Flexible payments Scalable usage and Automatic updates: Salesforce is an example of SaaS</li><li><p><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/eu/">Visit Saleforces Website</a></p></li></h3>
        <h3 style="color:white;"><li>Platform as a service(PaaS):</li><li>Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model in which a third-party provider delivers hardware and software tools -- usually those needed for application development -- to users over the internet. A PaaS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure. As a result, PaaS frees users from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application. PaaS does not typically replace a business's entire IT infrastructure. Instead, a business relies on PaaS providers for key services, such as application hosting or Java development.

A PaaS provider builds and supplies a resilient and optimized environment on which users can install applications and data sets. Users can focus on creating and running applications rather than constructing and maintaining the underlying infrastructure and services.Cloud 9 is an example of a PaaS</li><li><p><a href="https://c9.io/login">Visit the Cloud 9 Website</a></p></li></h3>
        <h3 style="color:white;"><li>Infrastruture as a service (IaaS):</li><li>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a form of cloud computing that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. In an IaaS model, a cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components traditionally present in an on-premises data center, including servers, storage and networking hardware, as well as the virtualization or hypervisor layer.

The IaaS provider also supplies a range of services to accompany those infrastructure components. These can include detailed billing, monitoring, log access, security, load balancing and clustering, as well as storage resiliency, such as backup, replication and recovery. These services are increasingly policy-driven, enabling IaaS users to implement greater levels of automation and orchestration for important infrastructure tasks. For example, a user can implement policies to drive load balancing to maintain application availability and performance.

        <h3 style="color:white;"><li>Communications as a Service (CaaS):</li><li>Communications as a Service (CaaS) is an outsourced enterprise communications solution that can be leased from a single vendor. The CaaS vendor is responsible for all hardware and software management and offers guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS). CaaS allows businesses to selectively deploy communications devices and modes on a pay-as-you-go, as-needed basis. This approach eliminates the large capital investment and ongoing overhead for a system whose capacity may often exceed or fall short of current demand.

CaaS offers flexibility and expandability that small and medium-sized business might not otherwise afford, allowing for the addition of devices, modes or coverage on demand. The network capacity and feature set can be changed from day to day if necessary so that functionality keeps pace with demand and resources are not wasted. There is no risk of the system becoming obsolete and requiring periodic major upgrades or replacement.Gmail is an example of a CaaS</li><li><p><a href="https://www.google.com/gmail/about/#">Visit Gmails Website</a></p></li></h3>
